# Project-2-Early-demo

***KNOWN PROBLEM***
On download a .ucas file likes to rename itself. There is likely a .ucas file in there that needs to be renamed:
- packaged game>Windows>project_BigBoss>
- the 2.75gb file should be named: Project_BigBoss-Windows.ucas

then after that you should just have to run the .exe
